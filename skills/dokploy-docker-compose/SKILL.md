# Dokploy Docker Compose Deployment Skill

## Overview

Dokploy is a self-hosted deployment platform that manages Docker containers on a VPS. It supports two
compose modes (Docker Compose and Docker Stack) and requires specific patterns to work reliably.

**Quick decision tree:**
- Single-repo app with `Dockerfile`? → **Application (Git)** deployment
- Pre-built images or multi-service stack? → **Compose** deployment
- Need a public HTTPS domain? → **Domains tab** (Dokploy auto-injects Traefik labels)
- Need isolated networking per-app? → Enable **Isolated Deployments** in UI
- Config files needed without SSH? → **File Mounts** in Advanced → Mounts
- Complex stack needing generated configs + binary downloads? → **Init Containers** pattern

---

## Part 1: Service Types

### Compose (Docker Compose mode)
Best for: multi-service stacks using pre-built images. Standard `docker compose up` behavior.

Key constraints vs running locally:
- Each deploy via AutoDeploy does a **`git clone`** which clears the repository directory — any relative path like `./config.yaml` will be **empty or missing** after the first push
- Never use `container_name:` on services — it breaks Dokploy's logs, metrics, and monitoring features
- Relative bind mounts (`./data`) work only on first deploy; use `../files/` or named volumes instead

### Stack (Docker Swarm mode)
Docker Stack mode for orchestrated deployments. Key differences from Compose mode:
- **No `build:` directive** — must use pre-built images from a registry
- Traefik labels must go under **`deploy.labels`**, not directly under `labels`
- Add `--with-registry-auth` flag in Advanced → Command if using private registries with replicas

### Application (Git) Deployment
Best for: source code you build from a Dockerfile.

Steps: Create Service → Application → Source: Git → Build Type: Dockerfile → configure Volumes and Ports in Advanced.

---

## Part 2: Volume Strategy

⚠️ **Critical Dokploy rule:** Absolute host paths (e.g., `/opt/myapp/`) are **cleaned up during deployments**. Never use them. Use the `../files/` folder or named volumes instead.

### Named Volumes (Best for databases and large data)
```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```
Docker manages these. Supports **automated backups** via Dokploy's Volume Backups feature. Best for databases, large datasets.

### `../files/` Bind Mounts (Best for config files and small data)
Dokploy provides a persistent `../files/` folder that survives deployments:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ../files/my-config:/etc/myapp/config    ✅ persists across deploys
  - ../files/my-database:/var/lib/mysql     ✅ persists across deploys
  - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml          ❌ wiped on each AutoDeploy (git clone)
  - /opt/myapp/data:/app/data               ❌ absolute paths are cleaned up by Dokploy
```
No direct host file access needed. Best for config files, small datasets. No backup support.

**Host path on the VPS:** `../files/` maps to a `files/` folder inside Dokploy's project directory on the host. To find the exact path after first deploy, SSH in and run:
```bash
# Step 1: find your container name (Dokploy names them <stack>-<service>-1)
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}" | grep <service-keyword>

# Step 2: inspect that container to see where ../files/ maps on the host
docker inspect <container-name> | grep -A2 '"Source"'
```
Or check the **Docker tab** in the Dokploy UI — the container name is listed there directly.

### File Mounts (Dokploy UI — for pasting config content directly)
In **Advanced → Mounts → Add Mount → File Mount**:
- **Content**: paste the file text
- **File Path**: just the filename (e.g., `config.yaml`)
- **Mount Path**: full container path (e.g., `/app/config/config.yaml`)

✅ Best for: config files you want to manage entirely in Dokploy UI
❌ Not for: binary files, files needing runtime generation, files > a few KB

### Init Container Pattern (for complex stacks needing generated configs)
When a stack needs multiple config files written at runtime, or binary downloads, use an alpine init
container that writes files into a shared named volume before the main service starts:

```yaml
services:
  my-conf:
    image: alpine:3.20
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -lc
      - |
        cat > /config/app.yaml <<'YAML'
        key: value
        YAML
        apk add --no-cache wget && wget -O /scripts/tool "https://..."
    volumes:
      - app-config:/config
      - app-scripts:/scripts
    restart: "no"   # MUST exit after running

  app:
    depends_on:
      my-conf:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    volumes:
      - app-config:/etc/app/
      - app-scripts:/usr/local/scripts/
```

**Shell escaping:** Use `$$` inside compose heredocs — `$$(uname -s)` not `$(uname -s)`.

See `references/init-container-patterns.md` for complete examples.

### Choosing the Right Volume Method

| Need | Method |
|------|--------|
| Database data | Named volume |
| Automated backups to S3 | Named volume (only option) |
| Config file — manage in UI | File Mount |
| Config file — large or complex | `../files/` bind mount |
| Generated configs + binaries | Init container → named volume |
| ❌ Do NOT use | Absolute host paths, `./` relative paths |

---

## Part 3: Environment Variables

### How Dokploy handles env vars
Variables set in the **Environment tab** are written to a `.env` file in the same directory as
`docker-compose.yml`. They are **NOT automatically injected** into containers. You must explicitly
load them in your compose YAML using one of two approaches:

**Option A — Load all variables (simpler for many vars):**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    env_file:
      - .env        # loads every variable from Dokploy's Environment tab
```

**Option B — Select specific variables:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - PORT=3000                   # hardcoded values also work
```

⚠️ If you use `environment:` with explicit variables, only those listed variables are passed.
Any variable set in the UI but not listed here will be silently ignored.

**Recommendation:** For stacks with many secrets (LibreChat, etc.) use `env_file: - .env` on each
service that needs them. For stacks where services need different subsets, use explicit `${VAR}` refs.

### Generate secure values
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32    # 64-char hex string (for keys like CREDS_KEY)
openssl rand -hex 16    # 32-char hex string (for IVs like CREDS_IV)
```

---

## Part 4: Domains & Traefik Routing

Dokploy uses Traefik as a reverse proxy. There are two ways to expose services via a domain.

### Method 1: Dokploy Domains UI (Recommended — since v0.7.0)
Go to your service → **Domains tab** → **Add Domain**. Dokploy **automatically injects** the
correct Traefik labels into your compose file at deploy time. You never touch the labels manually.

- Use `expose:` (not `ports:`) in your compose YAML when routing via domain
- Use **Preview Compose** button to see the final compose file with auto-injected labels

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    expose:
      - 3000    # container-only; Traefik routes via domain, no host port needed
```

### Method 2: Manual Traefik Labels (Advanced)
For fine-grained control, add labels directly in your compose file. Requires connecting to
`dokploy-network` (the shared Traefik network):

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: myapp:latest
    expose:
      - 3000
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.my-unique-name.rule=Host(`app.yourdomain.com`)
      - traefik.http.routers.my-unique-name.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.my-unique-name.tls.certResolver=letsencrypt
      - traefik.http.services.my-unique-name.loadbalancer.server.port=3000

networks:
  dokploy-network:
    external: true
```

**For Docker Stack** — labels go under `deploy.labels`:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: myapp:latest
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`app.yourdomain.com`)
        - traefik.http.services.my-app.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
```

### Isolated Deployments
Enable this in the Dokploy UI (toggle on the Compose service page) to give your stack its own
private network instead of sharing `dokploy-network`. This is:
- Required when running **multiple instances** of the same app (e.g., two WordPress sites)
- Safer — services aren't visible across other stacks
- Automatic — Dokploy handles all network creation and Traefik wiring

When Isolated Deployments is enabled, you don't need to add `dokploy-network` manually.
All open-source templates shipped with Dokploy have this enabled by default.

⚠️ If NOT using Isolated Deployments, only the domain-targeted service gets `dokploy-network`
added automatically. Other services in the stack won't be on that network unless you add it manually.

---

## Part 5: Networking & DNS (EAI_AGAIN Fix)

The most common multi-service error:
```
getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN mongodb
```
Container can't resolve another service's hostname. Causes: race condition or DNS confusion.

**Fix 1 — Healthchecks + proper `depends_on`** (prevents race conditions):
```yaml
services:
  api:
    depends_on:
      mongodb:
        condition: service_healthy    # waits until healthy, not just started
  mongodb:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
```

**Fix 2 — Explicit custom network** (guarantees DNS between services):
```yaml
networks:
  app-net:
    driver: bridge

services:
  api:
    networks: [app-net]
  mongodb:
    networks: [app-net]
```

⚠️ Avoid using `container_name:` as a DNS workaround — it breaks Dokploy monitoring features.
Use service names for inter-container communication instead.

---

## Part 6: Healthchecks

Add a `healthcheck` to every dependency service (databases, caches, queues). Pair it with `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` on services that need them — this prevents race conditions where a service starts before its dependency is ready.

**Example:**
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
  app:
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
```

---

## Part 7: Updating Deployed Services

### Manual update (public repos you don't own)
1. Go to Deployments tab → Click **Deploy**
2. If Docker cache is stale: look for "Redeploy without Cache" or clear Build Cache in System Settings

### Automatic updates via Webhook
1. Copy Webhook URL from **Deployments tab**
2. Add it to your GitHub/GitLab/Gitea repo Settings → Webhooks
3. Every push to the branch triggers an automatic deploy

---

## Part 8: Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN <hostname>` | Race condition / DNS | Add healthcheck + `condition: service_healthy`; use custom network |
| Config file empty after redeploy | `./` relative path wiped by git clone | Use `../files/` bind mount or File Mount in UI |
| `JwtStrategy requires a secret or key` | JWT env var not injected | Add `env_file: - .env` or explicit `- JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}`; **Redeploy** (not Restart) |
| `ENOENT: no such file or directory` | Config file not mounted | Use File Mount in Advanced → Mounts, or `../files/` bind mount |
| `permission denied` on volume | Old volume from different user | Rename volume (e.g., `data-v2`) to force fresh creation |
| Container `is unhealthy` | Wrong healthcheck for image | Match healthcheck command to image type; see Part 6 |
| Logs/metrics missing in Dokploy | `container_name:` set on service | Remove `container_name:` — it breaks Dokploy's monitoring |
| Services can't see each other after adding domain | Not on same network | Use Isolated Deployments, or manually add `dokploy-network` to all services |

## Quick Checklist: Adapting any docker-compose.yml for Dokploy

- [ ] **Remove all `container_name:`** — breaks Dokploy logs and metrics
- [ ] **Replace `./` relative bind mounts** with `../files/` or named volumes
- [ ] **No absolute host paths** (`/opt/...`) — they get cleaned up on deploy
- [ ] **Remove `user: "${UID}:${GID}"`** — causes permission errors in Dokploy
- [ ] **Remove `env_file: - ./.env`** — file won't exist; use `env_file: - .env` (no `./`) or `${VAR}` syntax
- [ ] **Add `env_file: - .env`** OR explicit `${VAR}` refs for every secret — env vars aren't auto-injected
- [ ] **Add healthchecks** to all database/dependency services
- [ ] **Update `depends_on`** to use `condition: service_healthy` instead of just service name
- [ ] **For domains**: use Dokploy's Domains tab (Method 1) unless you need custom Traefik config
- [ ] **Use `expose:`** (not `ports:`) for services routed via Traefik domain
- [ ] **Declare all named volumes** at the bottom of the file
